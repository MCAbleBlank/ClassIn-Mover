# CONTRIBUTING

## Preface

An open source repository needs to be maintained and created by people from all walks of life. However, to avoid
unnecessary problems with the repository in the meantime, we ask you to contribute to the repository under the
following requirements. We hope that you will adhere to these requirements and we will enjoy working together!

### Bottom Line

**We boycott pornography, violence, drug-related and other sensitive information!!!**

## Commit

For each contribution, the commit is essential as a bridge and plays a vital role in providing a concise overview of the
repository's history to any viewers or interested collaborators.

### Commit Nomenclature

- Please use English
- Avoid long sentences and try to use short phrases
- Nor should it be so short as to be unintelligible, for example

> fix

Good name:

> Update history.md

### Contents of Commit

Contents of a commit can be optimised codes, a new feature, even if it is not yet perfect enough to be
released. But we don't want to see fragmented commits.

## In Issues & PR

In these two sections above, you are free to post comments related to this project. But please note
our [bottom line](#Bottom-Line).

However, you will still need to use English, as we respect and welcome developers from all countries.

### Issues

This section is intended for a wider audiences (users, developers, etc.) and you can give us your valuable suggestions in
this section, whether you are a developer or not. We will accept it with an open mind.
For this reason, we do not require much in this section, you only need to use English (including machine translation)

### PR

In line with commit, we want your PR to be organised. That is, the timing of your PR opening is well thought out. We
will work with you to refine your PR, but only if it is relatively mature. But please note
our [bottom line](#Bottom-Line).
