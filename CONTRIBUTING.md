unnecessary problems with the repository in the meantime, we ask that you contribute to the repository with the
following requirements. We hope that you will adhere to these requirements and that we will enjoy working together!

### Bottom Line

## Commit

For each contribution, the commit is essential as a bridge and plays a vital role in providing a concise overview of the
repository's history to any viewers or interested collaborators.

### Commit Nomenclature

### Contents of Commit

Among the content of a commit can be an optimised code, a new feature, even if it is not yet perfect enough to be
released. But we don't want to see that fragmented commits.
